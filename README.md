## Introduction

Hi, we are Team 9; and this is a repository for our codebase.  

Our primary objective is **to help people** with an interest in subjective well-being (including politicians and bureaucrats) **understand which feature impacts the Happiness Score the most** so that they can try improving it.  

To gain some understanding of our project before playing around with our Decision Support System, please refer to the documents below:

* [Status Report (for development)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HikO9uLtq5pj5dgth8HtPZjJlEASzyajwIKiX_4ZXDM/edit?usp=sharing)

## Data

We used the ["World Happiness Report 2020"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/londeen/world-happiness-report-2020) dataset from Kaggle.

## Model

To achieve our main objective, we decided to create a regression model on the chosen dataset.  

This way, we would be able to determine the best predictor of the Happiness Score and predict the score given the value of each feature.  

As mentioned earlier, we referenced [MoemenGaafar's repository](https://github.com/MoemenGaafar/World-Happiness-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Project_Notebook.ipynb) to build a model.

## User Interface

We used Streamlit to make our own user interface.

## Instructions

* If you would like to **run the code on your local machine**, copy-paste the following command in the terminal:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/s00hyunkim/world-happiness-regression.git
    ```
